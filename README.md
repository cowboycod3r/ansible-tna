ANSIBLE TNA
===========

This is my ansible playground. Only tested and used with raspberry pi's and debian. :)


Roles
-----

- airplay clone
- dyn dns with ddclient
- wifi for raspberry pi

Encryption
----------

I have used [transcrypt](https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt) for encryption. Read the manual first.

1. Install transcrypt.
2. Checkout this project.
3. Init the repository with:

     transcrypt -c aes-256-cbc -p 'password'

4. start coding ...
